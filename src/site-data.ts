    intro: "DunaTerp reprogrammes carotenoid metabolism in the halophilic microalga Dunaliella salina. The core design introduces a project-selected transcription-factor regulator to redirect pathway flux toward a competitive β-carotene hub; four downstream product designs demonstrate what that programmable chassis can support.",

        eyebrow: "Value and production landscape",
        title: "Background & Challenge",
        body: "Terpenoids are used across food, nutrition, aroma, colour and other high-value applications. Current supply spans chemical synthesis, plant extraction and biological production, but each route leaves a gap: chemical synthesis can bring process and environmental costs; plant extraction is constrained by slow growth, variable abundance, land and freshwater demand; conventional yeast or bacterial factories often rely on sterile freshwater cultivation and energy-intensive operation. The project therefore asks whether a salt-compatible photosynthetic chassis can make this production landscape more practical."
      },
      {
        eyebrow: "Why this chassis",
        title: "A Chassis Shaped by Salt",
        body: "Dunaliella salina brings three connected advantages. First, its tolerance of seawater and hypersaline media supports low-cost cultivation in conditions that suppress many contaminants and reduces dependence on freshwater and arable land. Second, it already contains a complete MEP-to-carotenoid pathway and naturally accumulates β-carotene, providing an accessible and predictable starting network for engineering. Third, its photosynthetic, salt-compatible biology opens a broad application space in saline environments rather than tying the platform to conventional sterile freshwater fermentation."

        title: "Metabolic Reprogramming",
        body: "DunaTerp does not stop at using a naturally productive alga. The project identifies and introduces transcription factor 2146 as a regulatory input intended to reshape carotenoid-pathway expression and redirect metabolic flux toward competitive β-carotene synthesis. This turns the native β-carotene pool from a fixed biological trait into the shared, programmable hub of the platform. LCYB remains the enzymatic gate from lycopene into that hub, while TF2146 provides the upstream regulatory intervention.",

        body: "The modeling framework follows the control chain from transcription-factor activity and promoter occupancy to LCYB transcript, active enzyme, lycopene conversion and β-carotene supply. A second layer examines how downstream reactions draw from that shared pool. Together, these models define which regulatory, expression, metabolite and kinetic measurements are needed to test whether TF2146 changes pathway allocation as intended."

BKT and BCH extend the hub toward astaxanthin; CCD1 cleaves β-carotene to β-ionone; BCH supplies zeaxanthin for the GjCCD4a–GjALDH2C3 crocetin route and the CitCCD4 β-citraurin route. The routes are designed as separate strains so each branch can be built and evaluated without presenting the four products as the core innovation.",
