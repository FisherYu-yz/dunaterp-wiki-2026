      p('These quality checks define how the calculated poses and scores are used in the project. RMSD values above 50 Å indicate that the sampled ligand placements are widely separated rather than forming a common pose family. Identical coordinates and scores across some mutant entries are treated as a model-generation or input-audit signal, not as independent evidence that the proteins bind identically. The Gln362–DNA overlap identifies a concrete steric incompatibility in the repaired full-length model. Together, these observations distinguish the role of docking as a way to visualise candidate interfaces from quantitative binding evidence.'),
